# recursiveHdf5
This is a header only library to have a simple interface to store data of nested classes recursively to hdf5. It is in particular useful in a case where one has a tree like structure of objects, where every node has a name and some data vectors that need to be stored into an hdf5 file. 

## Examples
```bash
make
./build/printRecursively
```
